# Teachable Redux

A significantly pared down version of [googlecreativelab/teachable-machine](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachable-machine).

Entry point and UI stuff is in `index.js`.

If you only care about the output after training, look at `setConfidences` in `index.js`.

The deep learning bits are in `js/WebcamClassifier.js`.

(Note: `package.json` is renamed to `.package.json` so that Glitch doesn't choke on it.)
